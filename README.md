The Indo−Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) is a critical species for coastal marine ecosystems, yet long−term monitoring remains challenging. Acoustic monitoring provides a non−invasive approach to studying dolphin populations, and in this study, signature whistles were identified from acoustic recordings collected around Jeju Island, South Korea. While conventional acoustic parameters such as minimum and maximum frequency, duration, and frequency excursion have been widely used to characterize dolphin whistle signals, they often are insufficient to capture subtle within-whistle patterns critical for individual and population−level differentiation. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel symbolic contour encoding method termed DAS (Descent−Ascent−Static). Unlike traditional whole−whistle classification or scalar descriptor approaches, the DAS framework segments each whistle into discrete slope−based components, preserving fine−scale frequency modulation patterns. Comparative analyses revealed that the DAS−encoded features achieved clearer population separation in unsupervised clustering and principal component analyses, explaining nearly 90% of the variance compared to approximately 60% for conventional parameters. Additionally, we confirmed that more than half of the whistles detected were signature whistles, consistent with previous studies, and emphasized the importance of accounting for repeated signature whistle production to avoid statistical bias. This study represents the first report of signature whistles from the Jeju Island dolphin population and demonstrates that symbolic segment encoding offers a more biologically meaningful and statistically robust framework for population−level comparisons of dolphin vocal repertoires, with important implications for future ecological monitoring and conservation efforts.
